          At St. Claret College (SCC) Bangalore, we believe that education is not just about academic success but also about overall well-being. Since our establishment in 2005 by the Claretian Missionaries, we have been committed to creating an environment where students feel supported, valued, and empoweredâ€”not just intellectually, but emotionally as well.

          We understand that mental health plays a crucial role in shaping a student's journey. College life can be exciting, but it also comes with challenges, pressures, and transitions. That's why we have built a strong support system to help our students navigate these experiences. Our campus is home to professional counseling services, wellness programs, mindfulness sessions, and stress management workshops, all designed to promote emotional resilience and a balanced lifestyle.
